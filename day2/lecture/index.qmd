## Connecting to Day 1

### Yesterday: Arbitrage-Free Pricing
- Law of one price
- Stochastic discount factor exists
- State prices and risk-neutral probabilities

### Today: Equilibrium Pricing
- **How** is the SDF determined?
- **What** drives cross-sectional differences in returns?
- **Why** do we observe specific risk-return relationships?

## The Central Economic Question

::: {.key-concept}
**How do rational investors choose portfolios, and what does this imply for asset prices in equilibrium?**

Answer: Optimization + Market clearing = Asset pricing models
:::

## Mathematical Framework

### Individual Optimization
$$\max_{w} E[u(W_0(1 + r_p))]$$
where $r_p = \sum_i w_i r_i$ is the portfolio return.

### Market Clearing
$$\sum_h w_h = w^{market}$$
where $w^{market}$ is the market capitalization weights.

### Result: Risk-Return Relationships
The equilibrium determines how expected returns relate to risk characteristics.

## Topic 1: Expected Utility Theory

::: {.financial-concept}
**Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility**
$$E[u(W)] = \sum_s \pi_s u(W_s)$$

where $u(\cdot)$ satisfies:
- Monotonicity: $u'(W) > 0$
- Concavity: $u''(W) < 0$ (risk aversion)
:::

### Key Properties
- **Risk aversion** and portfolio diversification
- **Certainty equivalents** and risk premia
- **Arrow-Pratt measures** of risk aversion

**Detailed development**: [Expected Utility Theory â†’](01-expected-utility.qmd)

## Topic 2: Mean-Variance Analysis

::: {.key-concept}
**Portfolio Problem**
$$\min_w \frac{1}{2} w' \Sigma w \text{ subject to } w' \mu = \mu_p, \; w' \mathbf{1} = 1$$

**Solution**: Efficient frontier in $(\sigma, \mu)$ space
$$w^*(\mu_p) = g + h \mu_p$$
:::

### Applications
- Mutual fund separation
- Tangency portfolio
- Capital allocation line

**Mathematical details**: [Mean-Variance Analysis â†’](02-mean-variance.qmd)

## Topic 3: HARA and Two-Fund Separation

::: {.financial-concept}
**HARA Utility Class**
$$u(W) = \frac{1-\gamma}{\gamma} \left( \frac{W - W_0}{1-\gamma} \right)^{\gamma}$$

**Cass-Stiglitz Theorem**: With HARA utility, all investors hold combinations of the same two mutual funds.
:::

### Economic Implications
- **Separation of portfolio choice** from individual characteristics
- **Mutual fund industry** theoretical justification
- **CAPM foundations** from individual optimization

**Proof and applications**: [HARA and Separation â†’](03-hara-separation.qmd)

## Topic 4: Capital Asset Pricing Model

::: {.financial-concept}
**CAPM Equation**
$$E[r_i] - r_f = \beta_i (E[r_m] - r_f)$$

where $\beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(r_i, r_m)}{\text{Var}(r_m)}$
:::

### Derivation Steps
1. **Individual optimization** with mean-variance preferences
2. **Market clearing** condition
3. **Tangency portfolio** = market portfolio
4. **Beta pricing** emerges from equilibrium

**Complete derivation**: [CAPM Theory â†’](04-capm.qmd)

## Topic 5: Arbitrage Pricing Theory

::: {.financial-concept}
**APT Equation**
$$E[r_i] - r_f = \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_{i,k} \lambda_k$$

where $\beta_{i,k}$ are factor loadings and $\lambda_k$ are risk premia.
:::

### Key Differences from CAPM
- **Multiple factors** vs. single market factor
- **Arbitrage arguments** vs. equilibrium optimization
- **Fewer assumptions** about preferences and distributions

**Theory and applications**: [Arbitrage Pricing Theory â†’](05-apt.qmd)

## From Static to Dynamic

### What We've Achieved Today
- **Static portfolio choice** theory
- **Single-period** equilibrium models
- **Risk-return relationships** in cross-section

### Tomorrow's Extension
- **Multi-period** models
- **Dynamic programming** approach
- **Intertemporal** risk-return trade-offs

## Key Mathematical Results

### Mean-Variance Efficient Frontier
$$\sigma_p^2(\mu_p) = \frac{1}{A} \left[ 1 + \frac{(B - A\mu_p)^2}{AC - B^2} \right]$$

where $A = \mathbf{1}' \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{1}$, $B = \mathbf{1}' \Sigma^{-1} \mu$, $C = \mu' \Sigma^{-1} \mu$.

### CAPM Beta Decomposition
$$\beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(r_i, r_m)}{\text{Var}(r_m)} = \rho_{i,m} \frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m}$$

**Interpretation**: Beta depends on correlation with market and relative volatility.

## Economic Intuition

### Risk-Return Trade-off
- **Higher expected returns** require bearing **systematic risk**
- **Diversifiable risk** is not rewarded in equilibrium
- **Market price of risk** determined by aggregate risk aversion

### Cross-Sectional Predictions
- Assets with higher $\beta$ (CAPM) or factor loadings (APT) have higher expected returns
- Risk-free asset has zero beta/factor loadings
- Market portfolio has beta of one

## Empirical Implications

### Testable Predictions
1. **Security market line**: Linear relationship between $E[r_i]$ and $\beta_i$
2. **Risk-free rate**: Determined by time preference and growth
3. **Market risk premium**: Related to aggregate risk aversion

### Limitations and Puzzles
- **CAPM violations**: Size effect, value effect, momentum
- **Factor models**: Fama-French, momentum factors
- **Behavioral explanations**: Limits to arbitrage

## Connection to Consumption-Based Models

### The Missing Link
- **Portfolio choice** models explain how investors allocate wealth
- **Consumption choice** determines the stochastic discount factor
- **Integration** leads to consumption-based asset pricing

### Preview of Day 3
$$M_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)}$$

The SDF is determined by **marginal utility of consumption**.

## Problem Set Applications

### Theoretical Exercises
1. Derive the efficient frontier with $N$ risky assets
2. Prove the two-fund separation theorem
3. Show CAPM emerges from mean-variance optimization

### Computational Problems
1. Calculate optimal portfolio weights for given $\mu$ and $\Sigma$
2. Estimate CAPM betas and test the security market line
3. Implement APT with multiple factors
