## Fundamentals of Asset Pricing {.center}

::: {.financial-concept}
**Day 1: Building the Foundation**

Law of one price â€¢ Stochastic discount factor â€¢ Arrow-Debreu framework â€¢ Arbitrage and market completeness
:::

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will understand:

- The law of one price and its implications
- The stochastic discount factor (SDF) framework
- Arrow-Debreu state-space model
- Arbitrage and the fundamental theorem of asset pricing
- Market completeness and state prices
- Risk-neutral probabilities and their relationship to state prices

## Session Outline

1. **[Law of One Price and No-Arbitrage](01-law-of-one-price.qmd)**
2. **[Stochastic Discount Factor](02-stochastic-discount-factor.qmd)**
3. **[Arrow-Debreu Framework](03-arrow-debreu.qmd)**
4. **[Market Completeness](04-market-completeness.qmd)**
5. **[Risk-Neutral Probabilities](05-risk-neutral-pricing.qmd)**

## The Central Question

::: {.key-concept}
**How are asset prices determined in financial markets?**

Today we establish the theoretical foundation that will guide our entire course.
:::

### Preview of Key Results

The fundamental pricing equation:
$$p_t = E_t[M_{t+1} X_{t+1}]$$

where $M_{t+1}$ is the **stochastic discount factor** and $X_{t+1}$ is the asset payoff.

## Course Context

### Where We're Going
- **Today**: Fundamental principles and framework
- **Day 2**: Portfolio choice and static equilibrium
- **Day 3**: Dynamic models and intertemporal choice
- **Days 4-9**: Extensions and applications

### Mathematical Sophistication
We start with discrete states and finite horizons, then generalize to continuous time and infinite horizons.

## Topic 1: Law of One Price

::: {.financial-concept}
**Core Principle**: Assets with identical payoffs must have identical prices

**Mathematical Statement**: If $X^a = X^b$ then $p^a = p^b$
:::

### Economic Intuition
- Prevents riskless arbitrage opportunities
- Foundation for all asset pricing theory
- Does not require agents to be risk-neutral or rational

**Next**: [Detailed exposition â†’](01-law-of-one-price.qmd)

## Topic 2: Stochastic Discount Factor

::: {.key-concept}
**The SDF Framework**: 
$$p = E[MX]$$

where $M$ is the stochastic discount factor that "discounts" future payoffs to present values.
:::

### Why This Matters
- Unifies all asset pricing models
- Links asset prices to economic fundamentals
- Foundation for risk-return relationships

**Next**: [SDF derivation and properties â†’](02-stochastic-discount-factor.qmd)

## Topic 3: Arrow-Debreu Framework

::: {.financial-concept}
**State-Space Model**: 
- Finite states of the world: $s = 1, 2, \ldots, S$
- State prices: $\pi_s$ = price of $1 in state $s$
- Asset prices: $p_j = \sum_{s=1}^S \pi_s X_j(s)$
:::

### Applications
- Derivative pricing
- Risk management
- Portfolio construction

**Next**: [Complete framework development â†’](03-arrow-debreu.qmd)

## Topic 4: Market Completeness

::: {.key-concept}
**Complete Markets**: Every possible payoff pattern can be replicated using existing securities

**Mathematical Condition**: Asset payoff matrix has full rank
:::

### Implications
- Unique state prices
- Perfect risk sharing
- Welfare theorems apply

**Next**: [Completeness analysis â†’](04-market-completeness.qmd)

## Topic 5: Risk-Neutral Pricing

::: {.financial-concept}
**Risk-Neutral Measure**: Probability measure $Q$ such that:
$$p = \frac{1}{1+r_f} E^Q[X]$$

where $E^Q$ denotes expectation under the risk-neutral measure.
:::

### Connection to State Prices
$$q_s = \frac{\pi_s}{1+r_f}, \quad \sum_{s=1}^S q_s = 1$$

**Next**: [Risk-neutral framework â†’](05-risk-neutral-pricing.qmd)

## Mathematical Prerequisites Check

### Linear Algebra
- Matrix operations and rank
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Linear independence

### Probability Theory
- Conditional expectations
- Change of measure
- Law of total expectation

### Optimization
- Lagrange multipliers
- First-order conditions
- Constrained optimization

## Key Theoretical Results

### Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing

::: {.financial-concept}
**Theorem**: No arbitrage âŸº Existence of positive stochastic discount factor

**Economic Meaning**: Markets are arbitrage-free if and only if there exists a way to discount future payoffs that respects current prices.
:::

### First Welfare Theorem
In complete markets with no arbitrage, competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal.

### Second Welfare Theorem
Every Pareto optimal allocation can be supported as a competitive equilibrium.
