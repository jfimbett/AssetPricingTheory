## Problem 1 — SDF geometry in $\mathbb{R}^2$

Two equally likely states ($\mathbb{P}=(\tfrac12,\tfrac12)$). One asset with payoff
$x=(2,1)$
and price $p=1.5$. No arbitrage holds. Use the **pricing inner product**

### 1) Find one SDF $m=(m_1,m_2)$ that prices the asset
State the SDF pricing condition and identify one valid $m$.

### 2) Plot the payoff line and all SDFs in the same space. 

### 3) Decompose an SDF into parallel/orthogonal components to $x$
Define $m_{\parallel}$ and $m_{\perp}$ relative to $x$ using the pricing inner product, and explain which component determines price.

### 4) Only the parallel component prices the asset
Show algebraically that only $m_{\parallel}$ affects $p=\langle m,x\rangle$ and interpret geometrically.

## Problem 2 — Risk-neutral probabilities in a one-step trinomial model

Consider an extension of the binomial model seen in class. At date 1 the stock takes $\{uS,\,S,\,dS\}$ with $u>1>d>0$. Risk-free asset: price $1$, payoff $1+r_f$. There is an **ATM European call** (strike $K=S$) with price $C$. All three states are equally likely.

### Tasks
1) Find the risk neutral probabilities in this economy. 
2) Determine the bounds on $C$ so that there are no arbitrage opportunities.
