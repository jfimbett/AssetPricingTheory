## Law of One Price {.center}

::: {.key-concept}
**Fundamental Principle**: Assets with identical payoffs in all states of the world must have identical prices
:::

## Mathematical Statement

Let $X^a$ and $X^b$ be the payoff vectors for assets $a$ and $b$.

**Law of One Price**: If $X^a(s) = X^b(s)$ for all states $s$, then $p^a = p^b$

### Notation
- $s = 1, 2, \ldots, S$: States of the world
- $X^j(s)$: Payoff of asset $j$ in state $s$
- $p^j$: Current price of asset $j$

## Economic Intuition

::: {.two-columns}
::: {.column}
**Why Must This Hold?**
- Rational investors prefer more wealth to less
- If $X^a = X^b$ but $p^a \neq p^b$, arbitrage exists
- Market forces eliminate arbitrage opportunities
:::

::: {.column}
**Key Insight**
- No assumptions about risk preferences
- No assumptions about beliefs
- Pure logic of market efficiency

## Arbitrage Defined

::: {.financial-concept}
**Arbitrage Opportunity**: A trading strategy that:
1. Requires no initial investment: $\sum_j \theta_j p_j = 0$
2. Has non-negative payoffs: $\sum_j \theta_j X_j(s) \geq 0$ for all $s$
3. Has positive payoff in at least one state: $\sum_j \theta_j X_j(s) > 0$ for some $s$

where $\theta_j$ is the position (long/short) in asset $j$.
:::

## Arbitrage Example

### Market Setup
- Two assets with identical payoffs
- **Asset A**: Price = $10, Payoff = $(15, 12, 8)$ in states $(1, 2, 3)$
- **Asset B**: Price = $9, Payoff = $(15, 12, 8)$ in states $(1, 2, 3)$

### Arbitrage Strategy
1. **Buy 1 unit of Asset B** (cost: $9)
2. **Sell 1 unit of Asset A** (receive: $10)
3. **Net position**: $+1$ today, $0$ in all future states

**Result**: Riskless profit of $1 with no downside risk!

## No-Arbitrage Condition

::: {.key-concept}
**No-Arbitrage Condition**: There exists no portfolio $\theta$ such that:
- $\sum_j \theta_j p_j = 0$ (zero cost)
- $\sum_j \theta_j X_j(s) \geq 0$ for all $s$ (non-negative payoffs)
- $\sum_j \theta_j X_j(s) > 0$ for some $s$ (strictly positive somewhere)
:::

### Matrix Representation
Let $X$ be the $S \times N$ payoff matrix and $p$ be the $N \times 1$ price vector.

**No arbitrage** ⟺ $X\theta \geq 0$ and $X\theta \neq 0$ implies $p'\theta > 0$

## Implications of No-Arbitrage

### Portfolio Valuation
If portfolio $\theta$ has the same payoffs as asset $j$, then:
$$\sum_i \theta_i p_i = p_j$$

### Linearity of Pricing
For any portfolio $\theta$:
$$\text{Price of portfolio} = \sum_i \theta_i p_i$$

### Dominance
If $X^a(s) \geq X^b(s)$ for all $s$ and $X^a(s) > X^b(s)$ for some $s$, then $p^a > p^b$.

## Connection to Positive Pricing Kernels

::: {.financial-concept}
**Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing**

No arbitrage ⟺ There exists a positive vector $m = (m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_S)$ with $m_s > 0$ such that:
$$p_j = \sum_{s=1}^S m_s X_j(s)$$

The vector $m$ is called a **pricing kernel** or **state price density**.
:::

## Proof Sketch (⇐ Direction)

**Given**: Positive pricing kernel $m$ exists  
**To Show**: No arbitrage

**Proof**: Suppose arbitrage portfolio $\theta$ exists:
- $\sum_j \theta_j p_j = 0$
- $\sum_j \theta_j X_j(s) \geq 0$ for all $s$, with strict inequality for some $s$

Then:
$$0 = \sum_j \theta_j p_j = \sum_j \theta_j \sum_s m_s X_j(s) = \sum_s m_s \sum_j \theta_j X_j(s)$$

Since $m_s > 0$ and $\sum_j \theta_j X_j(s) \geq 0$ with strict inequality somewhere, the sum must be positive. **Contradiction!**

## Proof Sketch (⇒ Direction)

**Given**: No arbitrage  
**To Show**: Positive pricing kernel exists

**Proof Strategy**: Use separating hyperplane theorem
- Consider the set $K = \{X\theta : p'\theta \leq 0\}$
- No arbitrage means $K \cap \mathbb{R}^S_{++} = \emptyset$
- By separating hyperplane theorem, exists $m \geq 0$, $m \neq 0$ such that $m'y \leq 0$ for all $y \in K$
- Technical details show $m > 0$ and $p_j = \sum_s m_s X_j(s)$

## State Prices Interpretation

### Economic Meaning of $m_s$
- $m_s$ = "price" of $1 delivered in state $s$
- Also called **Arrow-Debreu prices**
- Fundamental building blocks for all asset prices

### Asset Pricing Formula
$$p_j = \sum_{s=1}^S m_s X_j(s)$$

**Interpretation**: Asset price equals the sum of payoffs weighted by state prices

## Examples and Applications

### Risk-Free Bond
- Payoff: $X^f(s) = 1$ for all states $s$
- Price: $p^f = \sum_{s=1}^S m_s = \sum_{s=1}^S m_s \cdot 1$
- Risk-free rate: $R_f = \frac{1}{p^f}$

### State-Contingent Claims
- **Arrow-Debreu security for state $k$**: $X^k(s) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } s = k \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
- Price: $p^k = m_k$

## Market Completeness Preview

::: {.key-concept}
**Complete Markets**: Every possible payoff pattern can be replicated

**Implication**: State prices are **uniquely determined** by no-arbitrage

**Incomplete Markets**: Multiple pricing kernels consistent with no-arbitrage
:::

## Limitations and Extensions

### What Law of One Price Doesn't Tell Us
- How are state prices $m_s$ determined?
- What determines the level of asset prices?
- How do preferences and beliefs matter?

### Need for Equilibrium Theory
- **General equilibrium**: Endowments, preferences, beliefs
- **Portfolio choice**: Risk-return trade-offs
- **Dynamic models**: Intertemporal considerations

## Practical Implications

### For Derivatives Pricing
- Replication principle
- Risk-neutral valuation
- Hedging strategies

### For Portfolio Management
- Identifying mispriced securities
- Constructing arbitrage strategies
- Risk management

### For Corporate Finance
- Project valuation
- Capital structure decisions
- Real options

## Summary

### Key Takeaways
1. **Law of one price** prevents arbitrage opportunities
2. **No-arbitrage condition** is mathematically precise
3. **Pricing kernels** exist if and only if no arbitrage
4. **State prices** are fundamental building blocks
5. **Linearity** of pricing follows from no-arbitrage

### Mathematical Tools
- Portfolio algebra
- Linear algebra (matrix operations)
- Convex analysis (separating hyperplane theorem)
