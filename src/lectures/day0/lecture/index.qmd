## Key Theoretical Concepts

### The Central Questions

1.  How are asset prices determined in equilibrium?
2.  What drives differences in expected returns?
3.  How do market frictions affect pricing?
4.  What role does information play?

### Unifying Framework

The **Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF)**: $$p_t = E_t[M_{t+1} X_{t+1}]$$

All asset pricing models are different specifications of $M_{t+1}$

## Mathematical Tools

### Essential Techniques

-   **Optimization**: Lagrange multipliers, Kuhn-Tucker conditions
-   **Dynamic Programming**: Bellman equations, value functions
-   **Stochastic Calculus**: Brownian motion, Ito's lemma
-   **Equilibrium Theory**: Fixed points, existence proofs

### Software Tools

-   **Quarto** for documentation and slides
-   **LaTeX** for mathematical notation
-   Mathematical derivations by hand and symbolic computation

## Course Philosophy

### Theoretical Rigor

-   Understand assumptions and their implications
-   Master proof techniques and mathematical derivations
-   Connect mathematics to economic intuition

### Research Preparation

-   Learn to read and critique advanced papers
-   Develop skills for original theoretical research
-   Understand frontiers of the field
