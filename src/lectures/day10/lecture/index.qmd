## Production Economy Framework

### Basic Setup

Consider an economy with:
- **Households**: Consume and supply labor
- **Firms**: Produce goods using capital and labor
- **Markets**: Complete contingent claims markets

### Firm's Problem

Firms maximize value by choosing investment and production:

$$\max_{I_t, K_{t+1}} E_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t D_t$$

Subject to:
$$D_t = Y_t - I_t - w_t L_t$$
$$K_{t+1} = (1 - \delta) K_t + I_t$$

## The SDF in Production Economies

### General SDF Representation

In a production economy, the SDF has two components:

$$M_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)} \cdot \frac{1}{R_{t+1}^k}$$

Where:
- First term: consumption smoothing
- Second term: investment opportunity set

### Derivation

The household's Euler equation:

$$u'(C_t) = E_t [M_{t+1} u'(C_{t+1})]$$

Firm's investment optimality:

$$1 = E_t [M_{t+1} R_{t+1}^k]$$

## Cochrane's Production-Based Model (1991)

### Model Setup

**Production Function**: $Y_t = F(K_t, L_t)$\
**Investment Technology**: $K_{t+1} = I_t + (1 - \delta) K_t$\
**Firm Value**: $V_t = E_t \sum_{s=0}^\infty M_{t+s} D_{t+s}$

### Key Result: SDF Decomposition

Cochrane shows that the SDF can be decomposed as:

$$M_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)} \cdot \frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}$$

Where $P_t$ is the price of installed capital.

### Proof

From firm's first-order condition:

$$P_t = E_t [M_{t+1} (F_K(K_{t+1}, L_{t+1}) + P_{t+1}(1 - \delta))]$$

Rearrange:

$$1 = E_t [M_{t+1} \frac{F_K(K_{t+1}, L_{t+1}) + P_{t+1}(1 - \delta)}{P_t}]$$

## Mathematical Derivation

### Firm's Dynamic Programming

The firm's value function satisfies:

$$V(K_t) = \max_{I_t} \left[ D_t + E_t M_{t+1} V(K_{t+1}) \right]$$

With:
$$D_t = F(K_t, L_t) - I_t$$
$$K_{t+1} = I_t + (1 - \delta) K_t$$

### First-Order Condition

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial I_t} = -1 + E_t M_{t+1} \frac{\partial V}{\partial K_{t+1}} = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial K_{t+1}} = F_K(K_{t+1}, L_{t+1}) + (1 - \delta) \frac{\partial V}{\partial K_{t+1}}$$

## Cochrane's Main Theorem

### Theorem 1: SDF Representation

In a production economy with constant returns to scale, the SDF satisfies:

$$M_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)} \cdot \frac{q_{t+1}}{q_t}$$

Where $q_t$ is the marginal value of installed capital.

### Proof Sketch

1. From firm's optimality: $q_t = E_t [M_{t+1} (F_K + q_{t+1}(1 - \delta))]$
2. Rearrange: $1 = E_t [M_{t+1} \frac{F_K + q_{t+1}(1 - \delta)}{q_t}]$
3. Household Euler: $u'(C_t) = E_t [M_{t+1} u'(C_{t+1})]$
4. Combine to get the decomposition

## Investment-Based Asset Pricing

### Cochrane's Investment CAPM

The expected return on any asset satisfies:

$$E[R_{t+1}^i] - R_{t+1}^f = \gamma \cdot \cov(R_{t+1}^i, R_{t+1}^k)$$

Where:
- $R_{t+1}^k$ is the return on capital
- $\gamma$ is the price of risk

### Derivation

From the SDF representation:

$$E[R_{t+1}^i] = R_{t+1}^f - \cov(R_{t+1}^i, M_{t+1})$$

And since $M_{t+1} \propto \frac{1}{R_{t+1}^k}$, we get the investment CAPM.

## Belo's Investment-Specific Technology (2010)

### Model Innovation

Belo introduces **investment-specific technological change**:

$$K_{t+1} = I_t + (1 - \delta) K_t$$
$$Y_t = F(K_t, Z_t L_t)$$

Where $Z_t$ is investment-specific technology that affects productivity.

### Key Insight

Investment-specific shocks affect:
1. The productivity of new capital
2. The relative price of investment goods
3. The SDF through investment opportunities

## Belo's Main Contributions

### Theorem 2: IST and Asset Prices

With investment-specific technology, the SDF becomes:

$$M_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)} \cdot \frac{1}{R_{t+1}^k} \cdot \frac{Z_{t+1}}{Z_t}$$

### Intuition

Investment-specific shocks create variation in investment opportunities that affects the SDF beyond consumption smoothing.

### Empirical Implications

1. **Stock returns** are more volatile than consumption
2. **Investment growth** predicts stock returns
3. **Relative price of investment goods** affects asset prices

## Mathematical Proof: Belo's Model

### Production Function with IST

$$Y_t = K_t^\alpha (Z_t L_t)^{1-\alpha}$$

Investment technology:
$$K_{t+1} = \frac{I_t}{Q_t} + (1 - \delta) K_t$$

Where $Q_t$ is the relative price of investment goods.

### Firm's Problem

$$\max E_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t \frac{D_t}{P_t}$$

Subject to:
$$D_t = P_t Y_t - Q_t I_t$$
$$K_{t+1} = \frac{I_t}{Q_t} + (1 - \delta) K_t$$

## Equilibrium Derivations

### Household Side

Utility maximization:
$$\max E_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t u(C_t)$$

Subject to:
$$P_t C_t + B_t = P_t w_t L_t + R_t B_{t-1} + \Pi_t$$

### Market Clearing

$$C_t + I_t = Y_t$$
$$B_t = 0$$ (no net supply of bonds)

## Key Results

### Result 1: SDF with IST

$$M_{t+1} = \beta \frac{u'(C_{t+1})}{u'(C_t)} \cdot \frac{P_t Q_{t+1}}{P_{t+1} Q_t} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\partial K_{t+2}}{\partial I_{t+1}} - \delta}$$

### Result 2: Risk-Return Tradeoff

$$E[R_{t+1}^i] - R_{t+1}^f = \frac{\cov(R_{t+1}^i, M_{t+1})}{E[M_{t+1}]}$$

With IST, this includes both consumption and investment risk.

## Empirical Evidence

### Cochrane's Findings

1. **Investment growth** predicts stock returns
2. **Stock returns** forecast future investment
3. **High investment** periods have low expected returns

### Belo's Evidence

1. **Investment-specific shocks** explain 30-50% of stock market volatility
2. **Relative price of equipment** predicts stock returns
3. **IST shocks** are priced in the cross-section

## Applications to Asset Pricing

### Cross-Sectional Implications

Assets that covary with investment opportunities have different expected returns:

$$E[R_{t+1}^i] = R_{t+1}^f - \frac{\cov(R_{t+1}^i, \frac{1}{R_{t+1}^k})}{\E[\frac{1}{R_{t+1}^k}]}$$

### Time-Series Predictability

Investment growth predicts:
- Stock market returns
- Bond yields
- Risk premia

## Extensions and Recent Developments

- **Belo, Gala, and Li (2013)**: Global investment shocks

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Production matters**: Investment opportunities affect asset prices
2. **SDF decomposition**: $M_{t+1} = M_{t+1}^c \cdot M_{t+1}^i$
3. **Investment risk**: Priced beyond consumption risk
4. **IST shocks**: Important for understanding asset price volatility

### Mathematical Framework

The production-based SDF provides a unified framework for understanding:
- Stock price volatility
- Risk-return tradeoffs
- Cross-sectional return differences
- Time-series predictability
