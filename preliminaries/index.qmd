## Welcome to Asset Pricing Theory

This section provides essential background material and setup instructions for the Asset Pricing Theory Ph.D. course. Please review all materials before the first class session.

## Course Prerequisites

### Mathematical Background

Students should be comfortable with:

- **Calculus**: Multivariable calculus, optimization theory
- **Linear Algebra**: Matrix operations, eigenvalues, quadratic forms
- **Probability Theory**: Random variables, distributions, expectations
- **Stochastic Processes**: Basic understanding of Brownian motion and martingales
- **Differential Equations**: Ordinary and basic partial differential equations

### Economic Background

Required foundation courses:
- **Microeconomic Theory**: Consumer choice, utility theory, general equilibrium
- **Financial Economics**: Basic portfolio theory, efficient markets
- **Econometrics**: Statistical inference, time series analysis

## Mathematical Refresher

### Essential Topics Review

1. **[Optimization and Lagrange Methods](01-optimization.qmd)**
   - Constrained and unconstrained optimization
   - Kuhn-Tucker conditions
   - Applications to portfolio choice

2. **[Probability and Stochastic Processes](02-probability.qmd)**
   - Conditional expectations
   - Martingales and stopping times
   - Brownian motion basics

3. **[Linear Algebra for Finance](01-optimization.ipynb)**
   - Matrix operations in portfolio theory
   - Eigenvalue decomposition
   - Positive definite matrices

## Technical Setup

### Software Requirements

#### Required Software
- **Quarto** for rendering course materials
- **LaTeX** distribution for mathematical notation

#### Recommended Setup
- **VS Code** with Quarto extension
- **Git** for version control
- **Web browser** for viewing rendered materials

### Installation Instructions

#### Quarto Installation

1. Download Quarto from [https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. Follow installation instructions for your operating system
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   quarto --version
   ```

#### LaTeX Installation

**Windows**: Install MiKTeX or TeX Live
**macOS**: Install MacTeX
**Linux**: Install TeX Live via package manager

Quarto will automatically detect and use your LaTeX installation for mathematical notation.

## Testing Your Setup

### Quick Test

Create a test file `test.qmd`:

```yaml
---
title: "Test Document"
format: html
---

## Mathematical Test

This is a test of LaTeX rendering:

$$E[R_i] = R_f + \beta_i (E[R_m] - R_f)$$

If you can see the equation above properly formatted, your setup is working!
```

Render with:
```bash
quarto render test.qmd
```
