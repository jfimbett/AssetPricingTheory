## üéØ Priority Tasks (Next Sprint)

1. **High Priority**:
   - Complete Day 0 and Day 1 structure with content
   - Set up Quarto configuration
   - Create functional navigation between days
   - Test HTML rendering of first two days

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Create preliminaries section
   - Add basic mathematical notation examples
   - Set up Python environment requirements
   - Create instructor documentation

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Add advanced interactive features
   - Create comprehensive assessment tools
   - Implement search functionality
   - Add multilingual support

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Overall Completion: ~15%

- **Infrastructure**: 80% complete
- **Day Content**: 0% complete (template structure ready)
- **Theoretical Materials**: 0% complete
- **Assessment Materials**: 0% complete
- **Documentation**: 60% complete

### Estimated Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete Days 0-2 with basic content
- **Week 2**: Complete Days 3-5 and preliminaries
- **Week 3**: Complete Days 6-9 and assessment materials
- **Week 4**: Quality assurance, testing, and refinement

## üîß Technical Notes

### Known Issues:
- [ ] CSS path references need testing across different environments
- [ ] Mathematical notation rendering needs verification
- [ ] Cross-references between lectures need setup

### Dependencies to Install:
